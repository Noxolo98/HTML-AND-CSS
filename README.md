# HTML-AND-CSS

HTML attributes provide additional information to HTML elements. In this case, the datetime attribute allows us to specify the date or time in a format that computers can understand. We write it like this: <time datetime="2025-05-08">May 8, 2025</time>.
We can add a br element at the end of each line, and voila, the poem looks correct. The br element is a simple tag without an opening or closing tag. It does not contain anything inside it; it just indicates where a line break should happen.
Subscripts, superscripts, and small text can be used where you need to mark up certain bits of content as having a different meaning than the rest. Subscripts are characters that are set below the normal baseline for text. Did you ever take a chemistry class and learn how to write the formula for water, H2O, where the two are lower down than the H and the O? The two characters are typeset as a subscript. It is set lower down. Superscripts are characters that are set above the normal baseline of text. 
Small, sub, and sup are the elements that can help you get the details right when it comes to typography and conveying the full meaning of your content.
There are numerous attributes like this, which provide browser APIs to JavaScript. To explore more, you can check out other courses. Additionally, the "lang" attribute allows us to specify the language of the content using a short language code. We will delve deeper into supporting languages on the web and finding these codes in chapter seven: Content Identification. The "dir" attribute explicitly indicates the direction in which the text flows, using "LTR" for left-to-right scripts and "RTL" for right-to-left scripts. These attributes, "lang" and "dir," are considered Global Attributes and can be used on any HTML element.
four most important Global Attributes: "class," "id," "lang," and "dir."
The class attribute <p class="intro"> This is the introduction. </p>
The id attribute <p class="intro" id="article-intro"> This is the introduction. </p>
Another popular attribute is the ID. It is similar to the class attribute, but we can only use unique names once on an entire HTML page. IDs can be used for CSS targeting, but are more specific, which can sometimes cause issues. As a result, CSS developers usually prefer using classes. 
The uniqueness of an ID name ensures that there will always just be one element with that ID.
ARIA is a powerful tool that greatly enhances web accessibility and is worth exploring further, especially working with a team struggling with semantic HTML or building a complex application interface. ARIA Roles provide the necessary tools to make your site accessible to everyone.
According to programmers, they enhance code readability by adding comments that explain its purpose. In HTML, comments are inserted by typing "<!--" at the start and "-->" at the end. These comments are disregarded by the browser. Code editors such as Notepad++ can display commented code or remarks in a grayed-out fashion, which proves to be quite handy. This feature helps us quickly identify when code is commented out and prevents any confusion when it does not function as expected.
When we want to create a link, we use the A element, which stands for anchor. To do this, we need to add an href attribute with a URL enclosed in quotes. This URL is where the link will take us. The term href stands for Hypertext Reference, a nerdy phrase from the past. Between the opening and closing A tags, we can place text or images, or both, to make them clickable. For example, we can turn the phrase "this is a link" into an actual link that takes us to example.com when clicked.
You might wonder about the difference between HTTP and HTTPS. The "S" in HTTPS stands for Secure. In the past, all web addresses used to start with HTTP, but nowadays, experts recommend using HTTPS for enhanced security.
