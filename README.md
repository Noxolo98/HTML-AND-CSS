# HTML-AND-CSS

HTML attributes provide additional information to HTML elements. In this case, the datetime attribute allows us to specify the date or time in a format that computers can understand. We write it like this: <time datetime="2025-05-08">May 8, 2025</time>.
We can add a br element at the end of each line, and voila, the poem looks correct. The br element is a simple tag without an opening or closing tag. It does not contain anything inside it; it just indicates where a line break should happen.
Subscripts, superscripts, and small text can be used where you need to mark up certain bits of content as having a different meaning than the rest. Subscripts are characters that are set below the normal baseline for text. Did you ever take a chemistry class and learn how to write the formula for water, H2O, where the two are lower down than the H and the O? The two characters are typeset as a subscript. It is set lower down. Superscripts are characters that are set above the normal baseline of text. 
Small, sub, and sup are the elements that can help you get the details right when it comes to typography and conveying the full meaning of your content.
There are numerous attributes like this, which provide browser APIs to JavaScript. To explore more, you can check out other courses. Additionally, the "lang" attribute allows us to specify the language of the content using a short language code. We will delve deeper into supporting languages on the web and finding these codes in chapter seven: Content Identification. The "dir" attribute explicitly indicates the direction in which the text flows, using "LTR" for left-to-right scripts and "RTL" for right-to-left scripts. These attributes, "lang" and "dir," are considered Global Attributes and can be used on any HTML element.
four most important Global Attributes: "class," "id," "lang," and "dir."
The class attribute <p class="intro"> This is the introduction. </p>
The id attribute <p class="intro" id="article-intro"> This is the introduction. </p>
Another popular attribute is the ID. It is similar to the class attribute, but we can only use unique names once on an entire HTML page. IDs can be used for CSS targeting, but are more specific, which can sometimes cause issues. As a result, CSS developers usually prefer using classes. 
The uniqueness of an ID name ensures that there will always just be one element with that ID.
ARIA is a powerful tool that greatly enhances web accessibility and is worth exploring further, especially working with a team struggling with semantic HTML or building a complex application interface. ARIA Roles provide the necessary tools to make your site accessible to everyone.
According to programmers, they enhance code readability by adding comments that explain its purpose. In HTML, comments are inserted by typing "<!--" at the start and "-->" at the end. These comments are disregarded by the browser. Code editors such as Notepad++ can display commented code or remarks in a grayed-out fashion, which proves to be quite handy. This feature helps us quickly identify when code is commented out and prevents any confusion when it does not function as expected.
When we want to create a link, we use the A element, which stands for anchor. To do this, we need to add an href attribute with a URL enclosed in quotes. This URL is where the link will take us. The term href stands for Hypertext Reference, a nerdy phrase from the past. Between the opening and closing A tags, we can place text or images, or both, to make them clickable. For example, we can turn the phrase "this is a link" into an actual link that takes us to example.com when clicked.
You might wonder about the difference between HTTP and HTTPS. The "S" in HTTPS stands for Secure. In the past, all web addresses used to start with HTTP, but nowadays, experts recommend using HTTPS for enhanced security.
While the simple HTTPS://example.com has been commonly used, URLs can be much more versatile. When linking to another website or a specific page on the web, you can include the entire URL. It does not matter if it has a trailing slash or not. These types of URLs are called absolute URLs because they point to a precise location on the web. In an absolute URL, the HTTP or HTTPS part must be included which stands for Hypertext
Transport Protocol. This protocol defines the rules for communication on the web and is crucial for linking.

You might wonder about the difference between HTTP and HTTPS. The "S" in HTTPS stands for Secure. In the past, all web addresses used to start with HTTP, but nowadays, experts recommend using HTTPS for enhanced security. When example.com is typed in a modern browser, it automatically adds the HTTPS:// part. 
Now, if absolute URLs were used for all the links, the browser will keep trying to access the pages or files at http://www.awesomedogs.com, which is not what we want. When working locally, we want all the links to point to the local copy of the files and when a copy of the website is placed on a testing server, we want the links to direct to pages and files on that server. To achieve this, there needs to be a way to omit the http://www.awesomedogs.com part of the URL but still allow the browser to locate the files.
To form a URL from scratch, you first need to grasp how files are organized. Imagine that there are a bunch of files neatly arranged into different directories or folders. If we want to link to a blog post from March 9th, instruct the browser to look inside the folder called "blog" and locate the folder named "March-9.html". Now, filenames come with extensions like .html, .jpg, .css, .js, whereas folder names simply have names like "blog" or "people" without any extension. The slashes in a URL indicate that we should look deeper into the file structure or go one level down.

Each link is wrapped in an element with the correct URL, and then enclosed in an "li" element to create a list of links. To maintain the order, wrap the whole list in a "ul" element, which represents an unordered list. Finally, encompass the entire menu in a "nav" element to indicate that it is the site's navigation.

To give the menu a visual appearance, apply CSS styling. Without the styling, it appears as a plain list, however, we also want screen readers and assistive devices to understand that it is the main menu. Now add some attributes to convey its purpose. Assign the role "navigation" to the "nav" element, which signifies that it represents the main navigation of the page. Additionally, include an "aria label" for the main menu, providing a descriptive label that can be read aloud by a screen reader. Remember, this is not the only way to correctly mark up a main navigation menu. There are various approaches that work equally well, depending on the situation.

To start off, use the image element with its ALT text and a URL to the image file. This ensures that even outdated browsers like Internet Explorer 11 can display the image. Now, wrap this image element with the picture element. This acts as a wrapper for the whole setup. Within the picture element, list alternative options using the source element. In this instance, provide two options by creating two source elements.

For the first source element, use the source set attribute to point to a mobile image file. This will be the cropped version of the photo, sized at 320 pixels wide. This way, when the viewport is smaller than 600 pixels, this version of the photo will be loaded.
In the other source element, use a kind of media query to specify the image for larger screens. When the viewport is at least 600 pixels wide, the landscape version of the photo will load. This is a pretty neat trick that allows you to optimize the image for different screen sizes.
Inside the HTML element, there are two main parts where everything goes: the head and the body. Create them using the head and body elements. The head contains all the metadata that the browser needs to know but will not display on the page. The body, on the other hand, is for all the content and is composed of various elements already discussed in this course. The body is where most of the action happens. 

The doctype declaration, HTML head, and body elements are the essential building blocks of every web page
The link element is a crucial component used extensively within the head section. It serves to connect various assets that should load, such as CSS files, fonts, and favicons. To inform the browser about the type of asset, utilize the rel attribute.

Additionally, the href attribute is employed to specify the URL for the asset. For example, a link to a stylesheet would appear like this, indicating the rel attribute as "stylesheet." A link to a favicon would also resemble this. Furthermore, you can also include a link to preload a font file. It is important to consider that the browser will load the files in the order they are listed. You are advised to place the items that need to load first at the top, while less crucial or delayed-use items can be positioned further down.

Remember, the main element is used once per page to wrap the main content, while the header, footer, article, section, and aside elements are the five sectioning elements in HTML. They are combined and nested to structure the content of a webpage.
Now, a button is needed for users to submit the form. Use the button element for this. The text on the button can be customized to whatever is required. Although the form looks good visually, it currently lacks functionality. To make it work, we need to connect it to a backend. We can add an action and method attribute to make a demo work, although using the "get" method is not secure and is not recommended for real websites.
It is important to use semantic form elements in HTML instead of divs and spans because it allows us to leverage the built-in power of the browser. This way, we avoid wasting time and effort trying to recreate functionalities that already exist in the browser. Moreover, by using HTML form elements, we ensure that forms will be compatible with all devices and input/output hardware, even those we may not be familiar with. 
Use the input element to provide places for users to input their name and email. Unlike other elements, the input element does not have a closing tag due to its older structure. It acts as a marker for the browser to bring in functionality and place it there. This is where the form's magic happens.
