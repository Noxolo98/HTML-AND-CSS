# HTML-AND-CSS

HTML attributes provide additional information to HTML elements. In this case, the datetime attribute allows us to specify the date or time in a format that computers can understand. We write it like this: <time datetime="2025-05-08">May 8, 2025</time>.
We can add a br element at the end of each line, and voila, the poem looks correct. The br element is a simple tag without an opening or closing tag. It does not contain anything inside it; it just indicates where a line break should happen.
Subscripts, superscripts, and small text can be used where you need to mark up certain bits of content as having a different meaning than the rest. Subscripts are characters that are set below the normal baseline for text. Did you ever take a chemistry class and learn how to write the formula for water, H2O, where the two are lower down than the H and the O? The two characters are typeset as a subscript. It is set lower down. Superscripts are characters that are set above the normal baseline of text. 
Small, sub, and sup are the elements that can help you get the details right when it comes to typography and conveying the full meaning of your content.
